Description: Remote control of Linux virtual consoles
 Conspy allows a (possibly remote) user to see what is displayed
 on a Linux virtual console, and send keystrokes to it.  It is
 rather like VNC, but where VNC takes control of a GUI conspy
 takes control of a text mode virtual console.  Unlike VNC,
 conspy does not require a server to be installed prior to being
 used.
