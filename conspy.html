<h1>
  Conspy<br>
  <font size="4">Remote control of Linux virtual consoles</font>
</h1>

<p>
  Conspy allows a (possibly remote) user to see what is displayed
  on a Linux virtual console, and send keystrokes to it.  It 
  works with Linux and FreeBSD, as far as I know.
</p>

<p>
  It is rather like VNC, but where VNC takes control of a GUI
  conspy takes control of a text mode virtual console.  Unlike
  VNC, conspy does not require a server to be installed prior
  to being used.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
  Sparse.  There is a
  <a href="conspy.1.html">man page</a>, a
  <a href="ChangeLog.txt">change log</a> and a
  <a href="README.txt">README</a>.
</p>

<h2>Frequently asked question</h2>

<p>
  Q: <i>Can conspy look at other types of terminals, such as a normal
  serial terminal, or a pty such as a telnet session?</i>
</p>

<p>
  A: No.  Nor will it ever be able to do so.  Conspy does not
  intercept the character stream being sent to the virtual
  console.  If it did that it would have to interpret all the
  ANSI escape sequences understood by the Linux virtual console
  exactly the same way Linux does.  That would be tedious, and
  would break each time Linux changes the escape sequences.
  Instead conspy asks the Linux kernel for the virtual console's
  frame buffer.  That is, it gets an image of what is displayed
  on the screen and makes your terminal look the same.  There is
  no way to do that for other tty's.  If conspy was to work
  with them it would have to interpret the character stream as it
  passes through the tty.  This is well neigh impossible because
  there are many different types of terminal out there and they
  all use different escape sequences.  If all you all to do it
  look at the raw character stream as it passes through the tty
  look up ttysnoop on
